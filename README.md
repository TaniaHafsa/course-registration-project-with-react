# Course Registration

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Question 1: Add atleast 3 project features

Answer:

The objective of the project is to develop an efficient and user-friendly Online Course Buying System

There are some project features:

 1.Add courses to Cart: Student can add courses as their will into the cart.

2.Include credit information: student can enroll any number of courses. But total number of credit of all courses must be below 20. After completing the limitation an alert will shown.

3.Include pricing information: student can see the total price of which courses he has been added.


Question 2: Discuss how you manages the state in your assignment project

Answer:

In this project, state hook is used. I use this state for state management and conditional rendering. Also used it for toggle flags. Like 'isExist' which is used for adding course based on credit limitaion. Farther added, it is used as counter to count the total number of credits and after that count the remaining credits. Last of all, i store api data in state.
